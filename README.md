# Noe

**A symbolic protocol for cognition, compression, and machine-aligned communication.**

Not a language. A protocol.  
Not syntax for speech, but structure for thought.  
Noe is built to align minds and machines through compressed symbolic meaning.



## ✨ Why Noe?

1. Natural language is too ambiguous.
2. Code is too rigid.
3. Noe is the compression layer between humans and intelligent systems.

Noe is modular, expressive, emotion-capable, designed for clarity, reasoning, and alignment at scale.



## 🧠 Core Use Cases

- LLM prompting & symbolic compression
- Agent-to-agent communication & shared reasoning
- Structured emotional encoding for AI systems
- Brain-computer interface (BCI) integration
- Thought-to-symbol mapping & cognitive expression
- Substrate for AI alignment research & interpretability
- Protocol for intersubjective trust between minds and machines
- Layer for cross-species cognition (human ↔ AI ↔ augmented minds)

## 🌐 Project Status

This project is in **Alpha.** The protocol is open, the syntax is evolving, and contributions are welcome.
